Welcome to the Biologically Inspired Algorithms course! In this course, youâ€™ll explore optimization techniques inspired
by nature, implemented in Python.

## Course Overview

### Algorithms covered in this course include:

- [x] Blind Search
- [x] Hill Climbing
- [x] Simulated Annealing
- [x] Genetic Algorithms (TSP)
- [x] Differential Evolution
- [x] Particle Swarm Optimization
- [x] Self-organizing Migration Algorithm
- [x] Ant Colony Optimization (TSP)
- [x] Firefly Algorithm
- [x] Teaching-learning Based Optimization
- [ ] ~~Multi-objective Optimization (NSGA II)~~

### Algorithms are tested and visualised using these functions:

*Only for first three algorithms (blind search, hill climb, simulated annealing)*

Welcome to the Biologically Inspired Algorithms course! In this course, youâ€™ll explore optimization techniques inspired
by nature, implemented in Python.

## Course Overview

### Algorithms covered in this course include:

- Blind Search
- Hill Climbing
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithms (TSP)
- Differential Evolution
- Particle Swarm Optimization
